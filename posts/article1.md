# Simple Markdown Article Example

This is a basic example of an article written in Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004. Its design goal is readability. You write in plain text, and it can be converted into HTML and other formats.

It's widely used for:

*   Writing content for the web (like blog posts)
*   Creating documentation
*   Taking notes

## Basic Formatting

Here are some common formatting examples:

*   **Bold text:** Wrap text in double asterisks or underscores (`**like this**` or `__like this__`).
*   *Italic text:* Wrap text in single asterisks or underscores (`*like this*` or `_like this_`).
*   You can combine them: ***Bold and Italic***.

### Lists

You can create lists easily.

**Bulleted List:**

*   Item one
*   Item two
    *   Sub-item A
    *   Sub-item B
*   Item three

**Numbered List:**

1.  First point
2.  Second point
3.  Third point

## Links

You can create links like this:

[Visit Example.com](https://www.example.com)

Or reference links later in the document (less common in simple articles, but good to know).

## Conclusion

This is just a brief introduction to basic Markdown syntax. It's designed to be simple and easy to write, allowing you to focus on your content. Practice using these elements, and you'll quickly get the hang of it!
